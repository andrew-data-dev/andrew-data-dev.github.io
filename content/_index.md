# welcome

Hi, I'm Andrew -- a database developer passionate about solving unique data challenges, implementing clean database design, and maintaining data quality.

I've worked across multiple industries, with experience spanning corporate, government, and higher education sectors.

I've included short summaries of personal projects I've worked on, either for fun or as part of my graduate degree. Feel free to ask me about any of them -- when I work on something engaging, challenging, and fun, I easily spend hours hyperfocused on it.

I feel the same way about work projects, but I'm more selective about sharing those details to maintain confidentiality for my previous employers.

# github

I try to be diligent about keeping my code in GitHub, but I learned about the value of version control later than I should have! All my recent projects use Git from the start.
