This project was done purely for fun and curiosity's sake. Check it out **[on GitHub](https://github.com/andrew-data-dev/WordlistGenerator)**!

There are plenty of common password lists available online, but I wanted to build a solution that generates custom, targeted wordlists based on specific keywords. The goal was to feed these tailored lists into Aircrack-ng on Kali Linux for network security testing.

Once you've deauthenticated a connection and captured the WPA handshake using the Aircrack-ng suite, you can run through your wordlists offline to attempt password recovery. For example, if I wanted to test the password strength for a local coffee shop named Joe's Java, I might start with a keyword list like this:

> coffee, joe, java, bean

I'd then run my Python script with those keywords as input. The script performs a variety of transformations to generate an extensive password list, including:

- Substituting common numbers and symbols for characters (e.g., "e" becomes "3")
- Testing different capitalization patterns
- Appending common numbers and symbols to the beginning and end of each word

The script then generates various combinations of these transformations:

- Capitalization combined with numbers, symbols, or substitutions
- Substitutions combined with numbers, symbols, or both
- Numbers and symbols in different orders and combinations
- All possible permutations of the above

This layered approach creates a comprehensive, targeted wordlist that accounts for common password creation patterns, making it far more effective than generic password lists for authorized security testing purposes.

My script would take the word "coffee" and generate 12,502 possible passwords. The first 300 passwords generated from the keyword "coffee":

The end result definitely needed refinement. To test the script, I had my wife set a simpler password for our home Wi-Fi network, but I was unable to crack it. Without knowing which keywords to use, I was essentially guessing blindly. Regardless, it was an enjoyable project that combined both coding and network security exploration.
