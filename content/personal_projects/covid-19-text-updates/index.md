At the end of 2020, during the height of COVID-19, I was completing my graduate degree and taking a course called "Mobile Health." For the final project, we were tasked with creating a mobile health solution. I built a proof-of-concept web application that combined my interest in Django and Python development with a real-world need: delivering timely COVID-19 updates via text messages.

The application allowed users to enroll in a notification service by selecting their state and county, along with their preferred update frequency. I sourced data from **[USAFacts.org](https://usafacts.org/about-usafacts/)**, which consolidated information from state websites and routinely validated its accuracy. The goal was to keep the experience simpleâ€”minimal user interaction and minimal information required to sign up.

Screenshots of the application's main page and opt-out page are shown below:

Orchestrating the operational processes was fairly straightforward. I created custom management commands within the Django framework to handle the core functionality. The workflow consisted of three main steps:

 - **Data retrieval and storage** - Fetch and store COVID-19 data from USAFacts
 - **Data aggregation** - Summarize data by county and update frequency for optimized processing
 - **Text distribution** - Iterate through registered users and send their personalized text updates using the **[Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api)**

This was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding projects I worked on during my graduate program. While it never went into production, I felt I had built something genuinely beneficialâ€”especially for people without smartphones. Text messages are an accessible way to reach all mobile phone users. They require no app installations, are unobtrusive, and provide a simple, efficient way to disseminate information quickly.
